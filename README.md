# Django_Hair_weaving_project
I created a website project for a hairstylist where they can showcase their braiding work. Other users can view and use these styles. The platform allows hairstylists to upload photos and descriptions of their braiding styles, and users can browse through the gallery for inspiration or to book a service.
